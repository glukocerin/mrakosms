# My Wikipedia site extras

I add some css features that Wikipedia not contain (They use JS)

## Notes to presentation

## signup form
1. autofocus for first input (username)
2. minimal html validate
  1. username and 2 password fields are required
  2. Add info username if focus
  3. Working captcha - Only correct text is "Follow the white rabbit!!!" -> if correct answer, change input background color

## test functions
- form element order -> tabindex (1. username, 2. pw, 3. pw confirmation, ...)
- css animated captcha (Drag the mouse to the white square)


## minor things
- form placeholder italic -> search placeholder normal
- captcha input autocomplete off
- language cog icon have hover, and title
- jump link to references
