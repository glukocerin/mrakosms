            <h3>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects</h3>
            <p>During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin  Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon torpedoes.</p>
